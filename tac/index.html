        <h4>9.	Online fraud advisory
        </h4>
        <p>Online fraud occurs when someone poses as a legitimate company to obtain sensitive personal data and then illegally conducts transactions on your existing accounts. Often called "phishing" or "spoofing," the most pervasive methods of online fraud are emails, counterfeit websites and pop-up windows, or any combination of these.</p>
        <p>Fraudulent emails often:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>appear to be from a legitimate, trusted source. You should not rely on the name or address in the "From" field, as this can be easily altered;
            </li>
            <li>ask you for personal information. These emails often claim that your information has been compromised or frozen, or ask you to confirm your identity;

            </li>
            <li>	link to counterfeit websites. These sites may appear legitimate, but actually collect personal information for illegal use. They may also include a link to the real website in an attempt to make the link seem legitimate; and
            </li>
            <li>contain fraudulent phone numbers. These telephone numbers are usually tied directly to the fraud perpetrators. Never call a number featured on an email you suspect is fraudulent, and be sure to double-check any numbers you do call. In addition, a legitimate number may be included in an attempt to authenticate the email.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To help protect yourself from these fraudulent emails and websites:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>never provide sensitive account or personal information in response to an email;
            </li>
            <li>delete suspicious emails without opening them. If you do open a suspicious email, do not open any attachments or click on any links it may contain;</li>
            <li>bookmark any sites that house personal account information and use those bookmarks to navigate directly to those sites;</li>
            <li>install and regularly update virus protection software; and
            </li>
            <li>keep your computer operating system and Web browser current.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>10.	Changes
        </h4>
        <p>HSBC may change the Digital Services or update information, material or content at any time without notice. While we shall make reasonable efforts to keep the Digital Services information accurate, HSBC is not obligated to update or correct information within any specified time period. HSBC is not responsible for information provided by third parties, whether the information is part of these Digital Services, is in any linked website, or is information about us that is provided on any website other than this one.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right, to change these Terms and Conditions at any time where we reasonably believe the change is to your advantage or is needed for any one or more of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>	to respond proportionately to changes in general law or decisions of the Financial Ombudsman Service;</li>
            <li>	to meet our regulatory requirements;
                    to reflect new industry guidance and codes of practice;</li>
            <li> 	to respond to the making of a relevant recommendation, requirement or decision of any court, ombudsman, regulator or similar organisation; or</li>
            <li>  to allow us to make changes to the way in which we manage the Digital Services or the service available through it as a result of changes to technology or the systems we use including introducing new services or facilities or replacing an existing service or facility with a new one.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>We have the right to make changes to these Terms and Conditions for reasons not stated above as long as we give you prior notice and you are able to end this service before the change takes effect without charge. We need this flexibility because we need to be able to manage how we provide our services over a long period of time and it is very difficult for us to anticipate all the circumstances when we may need to make a change to how the service delivered to you via the Digital Services works. If you do not like any change we make you can exercise your right to end this service and these Terms and Conditions between us. </p>
        <p>
            Where you are an accountholder, we will provide at least 30 days’ notice of any change to these Terms and Conditions to you.

        </p>
        <p>The current version of these Terms and Conditions from time to time in force will be available via the Digital Services. Where these Terms and Conditions have been changed and you need a further copy of any prior version which is not available on the Digital Services, please ask your Relationship Manager for a hard copy.
        </p>
